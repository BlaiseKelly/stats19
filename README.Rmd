# stats19

**stats19** provides functions for downloading and formatting road crash data.
Specifically, it enables access to the UK's official road traffic casualty database, [STATS19](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data) (the name comes from the form used by the police to record car crashes and other incidents resulting in casualties on the roads).

The data, in its original form, is provided as a series of .csv files that are stored in dozens of `.zip` files.
Finding, reading-in and formatting the data for research can be a time consuming process subject to human error.
**stats19** speeds-up these vital data access and cleaning stages of the research process, enabling reproducibility, by streamlining the work into 3 stages:

- **Download**: This stage is taken care of by the `dl_stats19()` function. `year`, `type` and `filename` arguments make it easy to find the right file for your research question.

- **Read**: STATS19 data is provided in a particular format that benefits from being read-in with pre-specified column types. This is taken care of with `read_*()` functions corresponding to the 3 main tables in STATS19 data:

  - `read_accidents()` reads-in the crash data (which has one row per incident)
  - `read_casualties()` reads-in the casualty data (which has one row per person injured or killed)
  - `read_vehicles()` reads-in the vehicles table, which contains information on the vehicles involved in the crashes (one row per vehicle)
  
- **Format**: in this stage labels are added to the tables. The raw data provided by the DfT contains only integers. Running the following commands converts these integer values to the corresponding character variables, for each of the three tables:

  - `read_accidents()` adds labels to the accidents table. The values in the `accident_severity` column, for example, are converted from `1`, `2` and `3` into `Slight`, `Serious` or `Fatal`.
  - `read_casualties()` formats the casualty data
  - `read_vehicles()`formats the vehicle data

A full description of the stats19 data and variables they contain can be found in a [document](http://data.dft.gov.uk/road-accidents-safety-data/Brief-guide-to%20road-accidents-and-safety-data.doc) hosted by the UK's Department for Transport (DfT).

## Installation

Install and attach the latest version with:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ITSLeeds/stats19")
```

```{r attach}
library(stats19)
```

<!-- You can install the released version of stats19 from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("stats19") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Data download

**stats19** enables download of raw stats19 data with `dl_*` functions.
The following code chunk, for example, downloads and unzips a .zip file containing Stats19 data from 2017:

```{r example}
dl_stats19(year = 2017, type = "Accidents")
```

Currently, these files are downloaded to a default location of "tempdir" which is a platform independent "safe" location to download the data in. Once downloaded, they are unzipped under original DfT file names. The function prints out the location and final file name(s) of unzipped files(s) as shown above.

Data files from other years can be downloaded in an interactive manner, providing just the year for example, would result in options presented to you:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dl_stats19(year = 2017)
```

```
Multiple matches. Which do you want to download?

1: dftRoadSafetyData_Vehicles_2017.zip
2: dftRoadSafetyData_Casualties_2017.zip
3: dftRoadSafetyData_Accidents_2017.zip

Selection: 
Enter an item from the menu, or 0 to exit
```

## Reading-in and formatting STATS19 data

As mentioned above STATS19 contains 3 main tables:

- Accidents, the main table which contains information on the crash time, location and other variables (`ncol(accidents_sample)` columns in total)
- Casualties, with data on the people hurt or killed in each crash (`ncol(casualties_sample)` columns in total)
- Vehicles, with data on the vehicles involved in or causing each crash (`ncol(vehicles_sample)` columns in total)

Code to read-in and format each of these tables is demonstrated below.

### Crash data

After raw data files have been downloaded (as described in the previous section), they can then be read-in as follows:

```{r}
crashes_2017_raw = read_accidents(year = 2017)
crashes_2017 = format_accidents(crashes_2017_raw)
```

What just happened?
We read-in data on all road crashes recorded by the police in 2017 across Great Britain.
`read_accidents()` imports the 'raw' Stats19 data without cleaning messy column names or re-categorising the outputs.
`format_accidents()` does this work, automating the process of matching column names with variable names and labels in a [`.xls` file](http://data.dft.gov.uk/road-accidents-safety-data/Road-Accident-Safety-Data-Guide.xls) provided by the DfT.
This means `crashes_2017` is much more usable than `crashes_2017_raw`, as shown below, which shows three records and some key variables in the messy and clean datasets:

```{r}
key_patt = "severity|speed|light|human"
key_vars = grep(key_patt, x = names(crashes_2017_raw), ignore.case = TRUE)
random_n = sample(x = nrow(crashes_2017_raw), size = 3)
crashes_2017_raw[random_n, key_vars]
crashes_2017[random_n, key_vars]
```

**Note**: The Department for Transport calls this table 'accidents' but a more appropriate term may be more appropriate, according to road safety advocacy groups such as [RoadPeace](http://www.roadpeace.org/take-action/crash-not-accident/).
For this reason we are faithful to the name provided in the data's official documentation but call the resulting datset `crashes`.

## Casualties data

## Vehicles data


<!-- More data can be read-in as follows: -->

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# old code to be up-dated
d14 = "Stats19_Data_2005-2014"
crashes_2005_2014 = read_accidents(data_dir = d14)
crashes_2005_2014_f = format_stats19_2005_2014_ac(crashes_2005_2014)
d15 = "RoadSafetyData_2015"
crashes_2015 = read_accidents(data_dir = d15, filename = "Accidents_2015.csv")
crashes_2015_f = format_stats19_2015_ac(crashes_2015)
d16 = "dftRoadSafety_Accidents_2016"
crashes_2016 = read_accidents(data_dir = d16, filename = "dftRoadSafety_Accidents_2016.csv")
crashes_2016_f = format_stats19_2016_ac(crashes_2016)
all_crashes = rbind(crashes_2015_f, crashes_2016_f, crashes_2017_f)
table(ac$Accident_Severity)
```

## Further information

The **stats19** package builds on previous work, including:

- code in the [bikeR](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/bikeR) repo underlying an academic paper on collisions involving cyclists
- functions in [**stplanr**](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/blob/master/R/load-stats19.R) for downloading Stats19 data
- updated functions related to the [CyIPT](https://github.com/cyipt/stats19) project
