# Defining SUVs

.pull-left[

No standard [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle#British_English)

- In USA: "rugged automotive vehicle similar to a station wagon but built on a light-truck chassis"
- In UK: "powerful vehicle with four-wheel drive that can be driven over rough ground. The abbreviation SUV is often used."

Data on weight and height is hard to come by

https://www.epa.gov/compliance-and-fuel-economy-data/data-cars-used-testing-fuel-economy

MOT data excludes weight: https://www.gov.uk/transport/car-motorcycle-and-van-mot-tests

But we do have good data on tax band

Previously my cars have always been midsize sedans. Chevrolets, Mazdas, etc. My intent was and may be still to purchase a more economical commuter. I test drove a Civic, Accord, Elantra, Sonata, Camry, Mazda3, Mazda6, Corolla, and Camry. I'm nothing if not thorough about figuring this out. I've noticed a huge uptick in the average size of vehicles around me during my 2 hours of round trip commuting each day (this is a newer job).

I really noticed this from the drivers seat of a Honda Civic. It seems like only about 10% of the vehicles in my area are actual cars anymore. Pickups, SUVs, Crossovers, Minivans. I never used to feel like safety was a major concern in a smaller vehicle, but it just seems like in the event of a crash I would be much more likely to be on the... squished... end of the accident. Is this unreasonable?

# Types of efficiency

.pull-left[

## Programmer efficiency

This is the amount of useful work a person (not a computer) can do per unit time

]

--

.pull-right[

## Computational efficiency

How quickly the computer can undertake a piece of work

One essential object is to choose that arrangement which shall tend to reduce to a minimum the time necessary for completing the calculation. (Ada Lovelace, [1842](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/introduction.html#ref-lovelace1842translator))

--

An efficient light shines bright with a minimum of energy consumption. In this final sense, efficiency has a formal definition as the ratio of work done per unit effort:

$$
\eta = \frac{W}{Q}
$$
