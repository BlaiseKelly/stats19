# Agenda

See https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/articles/stats19-training.html

## Day 1 Morning


09:00-09:30 Arrival and set-up

09:30-11:00 Introduction to the course and software

- Introduction to R + coding [video](https://youtu.be/7oyiPBjLAWY?t=357)/[links](https://github.com/jennybc/code-smells-and-feels)
- R installation questions/debugging
- How to use RStudio (practical in groups of 2)
- R classes and working with data frames (CC)

**Break**

11:15-12:30 Working with temporal data

- Time classes
- Filtering by time of crash
- Aggregating over time
- Forecasting crashes over time


---

# About the package

# R and RStudio demo

Actions speak louder than words...

---

# Over to you

Work through Section 2 of the exercises

- Projects and scripts
- Writing and running code
- Vewing Objects
- Autocompletion
- Getting help

---

# Time data

Section 3.4 shows how to change classes in R

Time is represented by special classes:

```{r}
library(lubridate)
x = today()
class(x)
day(x)
month(x)
year(x)
weekdays(x)
```

---

# Time representations

```{r}
as.Date("2019-10-17") # works
# as.Date("2019 10 17") # fails
ymd("2019 10 17") # works
dmy("17/10/2019") # works
```

---

# Subsetting time objects

```{r}
c_sample = stats19::accidents_sample
c_sample$date
c_sample$date_formatted = dmy(c_sample$date)
c_sample$date_formatted > ymd("2017-08-01")
```

---
# Next up

- Try running the code and answer the questions in Section 5
- Continue working through Sections 2 and 3

## After lunch

Spatial data (maps!)
---

# Spatial data and maps

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
crashes = readr::read_csv("https://github.com/ropensci/stats19/releases/download/1.0.0/crashes.csv")
crashes_sf = crashes # create copy of crashes dataset
crashes_sf$longitude = c(-1.3, -1.2, -1.1)
crashes_sf$latitude = c(50.7, 50.7, 50.68)
crashes_sf = st_as_sf(crashes_sf, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326)
plot(crashes_sf)
```

---

# Doing spatial data with R

- Context: spatial ecosystem (see section [1.4 of Geocomputation with R - package ecosystem](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/intro.html#rs-spatial-ecosystem))
- [Exercises](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/attr.html#exercises-1): Section 6 of the handout

- Further reading: [Section 3.2 to 3.2.2](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/attr.html#vector-attribute-manipulation) of handouts

---

# Practical

- Work through Section 6.1 and try exercises 1 to 3
- Take a short read of [Section 1.4](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/intro.html#rs-spatial-ecosystem) of Geocomputation with R (first challenge, find the resource online!)
- Return to the practical

---

# Afternoon session

- Talk on Road Safety 1

- Applying the methods to stats19 data - live demo

    How to access data with stats19
    Key stats19 functions
    Excercises: analysing road crash data on the Isle of Wight

- Continue working through the handouts
- Talk on Road Safety 2
- Homework - ensure that you have at least read-over the handout Sections 1:5

---

# Day 2

- Prioirty: consolidate knowledge from day 1
- Continuing to work through the handouts starting on Section 6
- Demonstrations of counting number of crashes on roads
- Talk on network analysis 
- Talk on R in a professional setting
- Working on your own data

---
