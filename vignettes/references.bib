  abstract = {Road accident severity may be influenced by a number of factors. This article investigates the relationship between weather and road accidents in England and Wales. The weather information recorded on Police Accident Report Forms was taken as the prevailing weather at the time of the accident. At the local authority level, accident severity for the various adverse weather categories of rain, fog, and high winds is compared with the nonhazardous condition of fine weather. Severity ratios are then calculated. Findings establish that accident severity decreases significantly in rain compared with fine weather, while severity in fog shows geographical variation. Evidence for accident severity in high winds remains inconclusive.},

Analyses were made of longitudinal changes in counts of road injuries within each of 119 029 road segments with at least one casualty with conditional fixed effects Poisson models. Estimates of the effect of introducing 20 mph zones on casualties within those zones and in adjacent areas were adjusted for the underlying downward trend in traffic casualties.$<$/p$><$p$>$\textbf{Setting} London.$<$/p$><$p$>$\textbf{Main outcome measures} All casualties from road collisions; those killed and seriously injured (KSI).$<$/p$><$p$>$\textbf{Results} The introduction of 20 mph zones was associated with a 41.9\% (95\% confidence interval 36.0\% to 47.8\%) reduction in road casualties, after adjustment for underlying time trends. The percentage reduction was greatest in younger children and greater for the category of killed or seriously injured casualties than for minor injuries. There was no evidence of casualty migration to areas adjacent to 20 mph zones, where casualties also fell slightly by an average of 8.0\% (4.4\% to 11.5\%).$<$/p$><$p$>$\textbf{Conclusions }20 mph zones are effective measures for reducing road injuries and deaths.$<$/p$>$},
