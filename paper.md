# Summary

This package simplifies downloading, reading and formatting DfT (Department for Transport), UK gov datasets on road safety from 1979 until present. 

# Statement

The aim of the package is to save R users to download the `zip` files released by the DfT and convert them into clean `df` R objects ready for processing. We have used the package internally to look at the state of the road safety and generate various maps using inhouse and R mapping packages. Therefore, although it is developed with road safety relevant people in mind, it can also be used by academics and educators as the basis for teaching.
